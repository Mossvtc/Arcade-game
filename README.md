HOW TO PLAY:

Use the arrow keys to move your player up across the grass and the stones to the water without getting hit by a bug.
You get THREE LIVES to start with.
Each time you reach the water, you earn an extra life.
You get 200 POINTS whenever you reach the water and 100 POINTS for each treasure you pick up along the way.
When you clear off all the treasures, more will appear!
